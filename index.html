            <p>Hi I'm Carter I was formerly a mechanic but I recently realized I wanted more for my future self and
                family than that would be able to provide, and have always been interested in coding and software
                development. This
                Led to make a decision to go back to school and to learn how to do it professionally. I really want a
                successful career in this field I'am very passionate about it and want to get as good as I can possibly
                get at doing it.
                I am very persistent and wont let anything stop me. Growing up I've always been interested in video
                games, computers, skateboarding, and cars. One thing those all have in common is that you need good
                puzzle solving skills
                to progress a lot of time. I'm not scared to try and fail as long as I learn from my failures and let
                them make a smarter and better person.
